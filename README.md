pedCamera
=========

Modification of "Critter-gram" camera (http://makezine.com/projects/crittergram-capture-cam/, https://github.com/Make-Magazine/Crittergram-Capture-Cam) 
that captures a JPEG image when it receives a "HIGH" value from either a button press or the arduino traffic counter.

Created during the Code For Seattle 2014 Hackathon as part of Bob Edmiston's wider traffic counter project for Seattle Neighborhoods Greenways
